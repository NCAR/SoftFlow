idea : online collaborative analysis through web interface
idea : general steps to use this UI
 1. user loads a json file that has a particular format for this UI
 2. User explores the file at north pane and selects target job(s)
 3. When target job(s) is(are) selected at north pane, east and west panes are automatically updated
 4. User selects data source at east and west panes
 5. User picks a type of analysis and visulaizations at center pane. Then an example plots are shown
 6. West and east panes produces a collection of json data. User selected analysis/visulataion has a particular format for them. So at south pane user maps source json data collection to target analyss json format

idea : theme of each panel
 north : intuitive explnation what is all about in terms of experiment, analysis and so on, Web page design
 east and west : all about data traverse, selection, and modification. JQuery?
 south : all about data manupulation for analysis, Python on web page? or Expect?
 center: all about visualization and analysis D3?
